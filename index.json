To do so, I started with a brief revision of probability theory and reviewing Gaussian processes. Why? Given that I am should be studying for my comprehensive exams, I thought that I better understand what it means to posit priors on the space of probability measures. As recommended by my mentors, a good starting point would be to look at Gaussian processes (GP) since I found Dirichlet processes very difficult to wrap my head around. GPs are convenient priors for continuous functions and they seem to be slightly more easy to understand.\nTo document my learning process of statistical theory, I intend to summarize some key theoretical underpinnings in this blog. We\u0026rsquo;ll see where this goes! In light of all the math below, here one of my favorite Calvin and Hobbes strip.\nAs a side note, I am part of the organizing committee for the 2021 Canadian Statistics Student Conference which will be happening this Saturday, June 5. Quebec also just announced that the administration of second vaccination doses have been sped up. All lot is going on, and it\u0026rsquo;s all exciting!\n1 - Probability Theory This section follows closely Chapters 1 - 3 from Probability with Martingales. For a more in-depth read, Probability and Measures sounds great but challenging. The main reason why I go through some (probably way too dense/deep) theory before jumping into Dirichlet processes (DP) is because DPs is a suitable prior over the space of probability measures.\n1.1 - What is a measure? Formally, we start with $(S, \\Sigma)$ be a measurable space where $S$ is some topological space and $\\Sigma$ is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by open subsets of $S$. A mapping $\\mu: \\Sigma \\rightarrow [0, +\\infty]$ on $(S, \\Sigma)$ is a measure if:\n (1) $\\mu(A) \\geq 0$ for all $A \\in \\Sigma$ and; (2) $\\mu$ is countably additive, i.e. $\\mu\\left(\\cup_{i=1}^\\infty A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\mu(A_i)$ and $\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0$.  Transitioning from general, super abstract sets, $\\sigma$-algebras and crazy measures, we usually define a probability triple $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ as followed:\n $\\Omega$: sample space; $\\mathcal{F}$: set of possible events $E \\subseteq \\Omega$ (and is a $\\sigma$-algebra); $\\mathbb{P}$: probability measure, i.e. a measure $\\mu$ such that $\\mu(\\Omega) = 1$.  Another more intuitive way we can envision measurable spaces is as $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}) \\stackrel{\\text{in words}}{=}$ (sample space, family of events).\n1.2 - What is a random variable? In statistics, we are interested in random variables and their properties. Random variables assign values to possible events in $\\mathcal{F}$ on which probability functions $\\mathbb{P}$ can be evaluated. Given a measurable space $(S, \\Sigma)$, a class of functions $h: S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is $\\Sigma$-measurable if, for all $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$, its inverse $h^{-1}: \\mathcal{B} \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ has the following property:\n\\begin{align*} h^{-1}(A) = \\{s \\in S \\,\\vert\\, h(s) \\in A \\} \\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mathcal{B} := \\sigma$(open sets of $\\mathbb{R}$) is the Borel set.\nWith this, a random variable is \u0026ldquo;simply\u0026rdquo; defined to be a mapping $X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that is $\\Sigma$-measurable.\n1.3 - Summary of probability theory (already?) The overarching idea is that, for a probability space (also called probability triple) $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$, we have the following mappings outlined:\n\\begin{align*} \\Omega \u0026amp;\\stackrel{X}{\\rightarrow} \\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\n\\mathcal{B} \\stackrel{X^{-1}}{\\rightarrow} \u0026amp; \\mathcal{F} \\stackrel{\\mathbb{P}}{\\rightarrow} [0, 1] . \\end{align*}\n2 - Bayesian nonparametrics When performing inference, we often posit parametric assumptions on the data-generating mechanism. However, this can be restrictive especially when we don\u0026rsquo;t know the functional form of such underlying mechanism. In these situations, we can turn to nonparametric methods which, as the name suggests, do not posit distributional assumptions and hence protects against model misspecification. In Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP), we can put priors on functions or probability distribution themselves. As Peter Mueller once said when talking about ANOVA DDPs, a type of Dirichlet process: \u0026ldquo;A BNP is always right in the sense, no matter the true distribution, our prior always puts some probability mass in some neighborhood of the truth so we can learn about it. It has full support.\u0026rdquo; (see video here)\n2.1 - Gaussian processes By definition, a GP is a stochastic process in which any finite collection of observations $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_i, y_i = f(x_i) \\}_{i=1}^N$ follows a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution with $N$-dimensional mean $\\mu(\\pmb{x})$ and a $N \\times N$ covariance matrix $\\kappa$ where the $i$, $j$th entry can be specified as followed:\n\\begin{align*} \\kappa_{ij} = \\kappa(x_i, x_j) = \\sigma^2_f \\,\\text{exp} \\Big\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\ell^2} (x_i - x_j)^2 \\Big\\} \\end{align*}\nfor some $(\\sigma^2_f, \\ell^2) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^2$. It is to my understanding that $\\mu(\\pmb{x})$ is often assumed to be $\\vec{0}$ (for reasons that are unknown to me at the moment).\nAn interesting way of using GPs as prior distributions is that, say we have $N$ observations $(x_1, f(x_1)), \\dots, (x_N, f(x_N))$, we want to perform inference on the unknown function $f$ without any making any assumptions on its functional form. Because any collection of observations $\\sim$ MVN, we are able to form predictions for $f(x_\\star)$ for any unobserved $x_\\star$. This stems from a well-established property of MVNs in that, if $(X_1, \\dots, X_N) \\sim \\text{MVN}$, $\\vec{\\pmb{X}}_{\\mathcal{I}_1} \\, | \\, \\vec{\\pmb{X}}_{\\mathcal{I}_2} \\sim \\text{MVN}$ where $\\mathcal{I}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{I}_2 = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $\\mathcal{I}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{I}_2 = \\emptyset$. Using this, we have that:\n\\begin{align*} \\Big\\{f(x_\\star) \\, | \\, x_\\star, \\pmb{x}, f(\\pmb{x})\\Big\\} \u0026amp;\\sim \\text{MVN}(\\mu_\\star, \\Sigma_\\star)\\\\\\\n\\text{where } \\mu_\\star \u0026amp;= \\mu(\\pmb{x}) + \\kappa_\\star^\\text{T} \\kappa^{-1}\\big(f(\\pmb{x}) - \\mu(\\pmb{x})\\big)\\\\\\\n\\kappa_\\star \u0026amp;= \\kappa_{\\star \\star} - \\kappa_{\\star}^\\text{T} \\kappa^{-1} \\kappa_{\\star} \\end{align*}\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\star} = \\kappa(\\pmb{x}, x_\\star)$ and $\\kappa_{\\star\\star} = \\kappa(x_\\star, x_\\star)$.\nBrief simulation To visualize the results above, I wrote a short notebook that shows the 95% equi-tailed credible intervals for all $x$-values.

Given the ongoing pandemic, my move to a new city for my PhD studies was put on hold. Instead, I decided to spend more quality time with one of my good friends (he\u0026rsquo;s a great cook!) and my parents. As spring was looming in, I quickly ran out of motivation to work on assignments and write my end-of-term report, but, with the help of my support network and all things considered, my first year ended well!\nWith summer right around the corner, I was eager for some good news and an opportunity to look forward to. On Monday, May 17 right before 2pm, I received the following email and nearly floored with happiness:\nand I had to immediately share this amazing news with my parents and my friends! I am extremely grateful for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) opportunity for the many reasons. Firstly, I will learn more about open source development and probabilistic programming from well-established mentors. Secondly, this practical opportunity would complement well my summer studying for my PhD comprehensive exams. Last but not least, I\u0026rsquo;m being paid! 😅\nUnder the mentorship of Christopher Fonnesbeck and Austin Rochford, my GSoC project centers around extending the PyMC3 package with a Dirichlet process submodule. PyMC3 is a probabilistic framework in Python that allows users to fit Bayesian models via MCMC sampling. There is a growing interest in Bayesian nonparametric methods for fitting statistical models without specifying its parametric form. Dirichlet processes can be used as priors for probability distributions themselves. How exactly? I shall find out in the next three weeks of community bonding!\nIn the coming months, I look forward to getting to know the PyMC3 community, reading more about Bayesian nonparametric statistics and, above all, learning from my mentors.

If you do follow this, please let me know if something is not working correctly!\nWhat is Anaconda? Simply put, Anaconda is an open-source package management system for Python. One of its most popular applications, Jupyter, is commonly used for data science related projects. In this article, I have tried to detail the steps from creating a virtual environment in Anaconda to using it in your Jupyter notebooks.\nInstalling Anaconda  Go to the Anaconda website here. Click on the appropriate distribution (Mac or Linux) and download the Anaconda installer for Python 3.7. Open Terminal and execute the following commands:  cd ~/Downloads chmod +x Anaconda3-2020.02-MacOSX-x86_64.sh ./Anaconda3-2020.02-MacOSX-x86_64.sh  If you\u0026rsquo;re on a Linux distribution, the downloaded file has a different name, so execute the commands above with the downloaded file name.\n❗ You should reset your Terminal window by simply restarting it.\nSetting up your virtual environment Creating a virtual environment for your Python project has many benefits, including version control for you and your collaborators and managing sets of installed packages for separate projects. Here are 5 steps to creating your Anaconda virtual environment and using it in a Jupyter notebook.\n1 - Creating the virtual environment conda create -n YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3.7  The command above specifies Python version in the environment to be 3.7, since this is the most stable and updated version at the moment. However, you can use a different version if you prefer.\n2 - Creating a Terminal Shortcut My preference is to create a Terminal shortcut to activate the environment.\necho \u0026quot;alias SHORTCUT_COMMAND='conda activate YOUR_ENV_NAME'\u0026quot; | cat - ~/.bash_profile \u0026gt; ~/.bash_profile source ~/.bash_profile  If you are on a Linux distribution, replace ~/.bash_profile by ~/.bashrc due to the difference in file names.\n3 - Activating your environment With the shortcut created using the commands above, you can now activate the environment by simply typing its name in Terminal!\nYOUR_ENV_NAME  4 - Installing packages Say you want to install some Python packages called package1, package2 and package3. You can use the code below to do so.\nconda install -n YOUR_ENV_NAME package1 package2 package3  5 - Adding the environment to Jupyter Often times, it would be desirable to be able to access the environment in a Jupyter notebook, which is often used for coding in Python (it\u0026rsquo;s definitely my favorite!). To add your newly created environment to Jupyter, run the following commands in Terminal.\nconda install -n YOUR_ENV_NAME ipykernel -c conda-forge python -m ipykernel install --user --name YOUR_ENV_NAME  Running into command not found: jupyter One of the packages that you may have to install is jupyter itself!\nconda install -n YOUR_ENV_NAME -c conda-forge jupyterlab  Ready to code! Your environment should be ready to use in your Jupyter notebooks!\n Other (hopefully) useful things Locating your virtual environment My preference is to go the folder in which your environment is installed and simply removing it. To find the directory in which your virtual environment is located, you can do:\nsource activate YOUR_ENV_NAME # to activate your environment which python  You should get an output under the following format: SOME_DIRECTORY/YOUR_ENV_NAME/bin/python. The directory in which your environment is located is simply SOME_DIRECTORY.\nExample When I run which python after activating my environment called ml, I obtain /Users/larry/anaconda3/envs/ml/bin/python. It follows that the directory where my conda environments are located is Users/larry/anaconda3/envs/.\nDeleting your environment Once you have located your environment (see above) and found the directory in which your environments are located and that we will call SOME_DIRECTORY. To delete your environment, run the following commands:\ncd SOME_DIRECTORY rm -rf YOUR_ENV_NAME  Removing your environment from Jupyter Although you have deleted your environment and it no longer exists, for some reason the option to select it as a kernel is still available in your Jupyter notebook, although selecting it won\u0026rsquo;t work. To remove the environment as an option in the Jupyter notebook, run the following.\njupyter kernelspec uninstall YOUR_ENV_NAME  ","date":1587841474,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621468711,"objectID":"1c7ccf0e695f579f2603b85c990035cf","permalink":"https://www.larrydong.com/post/conda-cheatsheet/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T15:04:34-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/conda-cheatsheet/","section":"post","summary":"Here is a cheatsheet in using Anaconda with some of my personal preferences that I have retained.
