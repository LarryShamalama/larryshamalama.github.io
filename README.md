# Welcome to my Personal Website!

To learn more about who I am and what I do, you're welcome to check out my website [here](http://larryshamalama.github.io/)!

### The Template

The template that I am using is called [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), which was built on top of the Hugo framework. Instructions are available [here](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/get-started/).

That being said, I still had a hard time to get things to work. The steps below are largely inspired by the instructions website above, but tried to make it as clear as possible through my experience, with images!

# How to host your very own academic website

Firstly, there are many ways to do this. You can use RStudio or Netlify. However, my preference was to host it on Github pages, because it is free and I am more familiar with this resource.

1 - Fork the *Academic Kickstart* repository [here](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart)

You should have a copy of the *Academic Kickstart* website as your own repository.
